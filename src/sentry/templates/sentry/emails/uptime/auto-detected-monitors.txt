We've Created a Free Uptime Monitor for Your Project

We noticed that {{ monitor_url_display }} appears frequently in your project's errors, so we created an uptime monitor to help keep an eye on it.

{{ monitor_url_display }} | {{ project_slug }}
Created on {{ date_created|date:"N j, Y, g:i:s a e" }}

This monitor will check your URL every minute and alert you if it goes down. It's completely free, and you can customize it to adjust the check frequency, HTTP method, headers, or request body.

{{ monitor_detail_url }}

Not interested? You can remove this monitor anytime, and we won't create it again.
