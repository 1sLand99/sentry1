/**
 * OnDemandDisabled is a component that displays an error alert when on-demand billing
 * has been disabled for an organization due to unpaid invoices.
 *
 * On-demand billing can be disabled in two places:
 * 1. At the subscription level via subscription.flags.ondemand_disabled
 * 2. In the current billing history period via billinghistory.ondemand_disabled
 *
 * When disabled:
 * - The organization cannot use on-demand capacity
 * - This may impact the organization's ability to accept data into Sentry
 * - The user needs to pay outstanding invoices to re-enable on-demand billing
 *
 * Integration with billing system:
 * - The subscription.disable_ondemand() method sets both subscription flag and billing history
 * - Re-enabling requires paying outstanding invoices and calling subscription.enable_ondemand()
 *
 * Component behavior:
 * - Renders an error Alert component when conditions are met
 * - Provides links to billing receipts and support email
 * - Used in both billing overview pages (with and without billing permissions)
 *
 * @param props.subscription - The organization's subscription object containing:
 *   - onDemandDisabled: boolean indicating if on-demand billing is disabled
 *   - onDemandMaxSpend: number indicating maximum on-demand spend limit
 *   - planTier: string indicating the subscription plan tier
